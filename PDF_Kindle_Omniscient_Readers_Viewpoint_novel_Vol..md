Overview
The global hit fantasy novel finally coming to print in English!Â  Struggling office worker Dokja Kimâ€™s sole joy in life is an online novel so obscure that heâ€™s itâ€™s only reader. Then one day the story comes to an end...and so does the world. Horrific monsters, ordinary people forced to kill or be killed, and Goblins gleefully streaming the carnage to a celestial audienceâ€”with the apocalypse straight out of his favorite novel unfolding around him, Dokja is the only one who can see this story to the finale!Â
