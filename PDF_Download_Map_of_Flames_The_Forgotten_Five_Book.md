Overview
X-Men meets Ocean&#039;s Eleven in the new middle-grade series from the New York Times bestselling author, Lisa McMann (The Unwanteds).

 Fifteen years ago, eight supernatural criminals fled Estero City to make a new life in an isolated tropical hideout. Over time, seven of them disappeared without a trace, presumed captured or killed. And now, the remaining one has died.

 Left behind to fend for themselves are the criminalsâ€™ five children, each with superpowers of their own: Birdie can communicate with animals. Brix has athletic abilities and can heal quickly. Tenner can swim like a fish and can see in the dark and hear from a distance. Sevenâ€™s skin camouflages to match whatever is around him. Cabot hasnâ€™t shown signs of any unusual powerâ€”yet.

 Then one day Birdie finds a map among her fatherâ€™s things that leads to a secret stash. There is also a note:

Go to Estero, find your mother, and give her the map.

 The five have lived their entire lives in isolation. What would it mean to follow the map to a strange world full of things theyâ€™ve only heard about, like cell phones, cars, and electricity? A world where, thanks to their parents, being supernatural is a crime?
