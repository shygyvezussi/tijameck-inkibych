The EGOT-winning composer of The Way We Were and A Chorus Line recounts his remarkable life from childhood to Broadway and Hollywood.
 
 The son of Jewish Viennese immigrants, six-year-old Marvin Hamlischâ€™s early musical talent and discipline led him to Julliard, where he studied for more than a decade. From there, Hamlisch got his start as a rehearsal pianist for Funny Girl starring Barbra Streisand. He went on to co-create the classic American musical A Chorus Line and wrote the Oscar Awardâ€“winning musical score for The Way We Were. Hamlisch is one of only a handful of people to achieve EGOT statusâ€”winning an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony.
 
 In this autobiography, Hamlisch tells the tale of his life and career, revealing personal stories of his childhood, his marriage, and his friendships with stars including Liza Minnelli, Groucho Marx, and others. It offers an intimate view of his life and a compelling portrait of Broadway and Hollywood through the second half of the twentieth century.
