Overview
&quot;Don&#039;t go in the guest bedroom.&quot; A shadow falls on Douglas Garrick&#039;s face as he touches the door with his fingertips. &quot;My wife... she&#039;s very ill.&quot; As he continues showing me their incredible penthouse apartment, I have a terrible feeling about the woman behind closed doors. But I can&#039;t risk losing this job-not if I want to keep my darkest secret safe... It&#039;s hard to find an employer who doesn&#039;t ask too many questions about my past. So I thank my lucky stars that the Garricks miraculously give me a job, cleaning their stunning penthouse with views across the city and preparing fancy meals in their shiny kitchen. I can work here for a while, stay quiet until I get what I want. It&#039;s almost perfect. But I still haven&#039;t met Mrs Garrick, or seen inside the guest bedroom. I&#039;m sure I hear her crying. I notice spots of blood around the neck of her white nightgowns when I&#039;m doing laundry. And one day I can&#039;t help but knock on the door. When it gently swings open, what I see inside changes everything... That&#039;s when I make a promise. After all, I&#039;ve done this before. I can protect Mrs Garrick while keeping my own secrets locked up safe. Douglas Garrick has done wrong. He is going to pay. It&#039;s simply a question of how far I&#039;m willing to go...
