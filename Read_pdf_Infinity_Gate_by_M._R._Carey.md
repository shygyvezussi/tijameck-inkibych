From bestselling author M. R. Carey comes a brilliant genre-defying story of humanity&amp;#039;s expansion across millions of dimensions—and the AI technology that might see it all come to an end. &amp;quot;A fascinating window onto a dangerous and multifaceted universe.” —Adrian Tchaikovsky, author of Children of Time

 INFINITY IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

 The Pandominion: a political and trading alliance of a million worlds. Except that they’re really just one world, Earth, in many different realities. And when an A.I. threat arises that could destroy everything the Pandominion has built, they’ll eradicate it by whatever means necessary.

 Scientist Hadiz Tambuwal is looking for a solution to her own Earth’s environmental collapse when she stumbles across the secret of inter-dimensional travel, a secret that could save everyone on her dying planet. It leads her into the middle of a war on a scale she never dreamed of. And she needs to choose a side before every reality pays the price.

&amp;quot;A genuine treat for SF fans: an epic multiverse tale that moves like a thriller.&amp;quot; —Kirkus (starred review)

&amp;quot;Readers will be wowed.&amp;quot; —Publishers Weekly (starred review)

&amp;quot;Infinity Gate, with its in-depth science and rich characterization, is a must-read.&amp;quot; —Booklist (starred review)
