She loves Christmas! Opening a Christmas shop in her hometown of Winterberry, Kentucky is a dream come true for Lexi Hargrove. Lexi is no stranger to loss, but her holly, jolly approach to life has sustained her. She couldn&amp;#039;t have imagined the first person to walk through the door of the Christmas Box would be Travis Hutchins, her long lost high school crush who stood her up for a date a dozen years ago. He&amp;#039;s looking for coffee, not Christmas - and makes it clear he&amp;#039;s a holiday hater. But why does he still have to be so hot? And when did he become so Grinchy? He hates Christmas! Travis never planned to come back to Winterberry, but his estranged father is dying. He just wants to keep a low profile, do his duty, then head back to his life in Chicago. Things he never expected: running into Lexi Hargrove, and an endless explosion of all things Christmas directly in eyesight of where he&amp;#039;s staying. When did she get so pretty? And why does he keep going back? Can one wish upon a Christmas star change everything? Lexi isn&amp;#039;t sure why she&amp;#039;s wishing for Hottie McScrooge across the street to find the joy of Christmas, but soon a whole array of Christmas wishes begin to change both their lives. Can those wishes keep Lexi&amp;#039;s shop open even when the situation looks bleak? Can they help Travis make peace with his dad before it&amp;#039;s too late? And can Lexi and Travis look past all their fears and differences to fall in love?
