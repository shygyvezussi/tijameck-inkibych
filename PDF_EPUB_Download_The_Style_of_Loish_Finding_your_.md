In this visually stunning hardback, globally loved artist Lois van Baarle, AKA Loish, explores the origins, influences, and features of her style, and helps readers do the same deep dive into their own style.   It is her third book with 3dtotal Publishing, a natural progression from the bestselling The Art of Loish (2016) and The Sketch Book of Loish (2018) which to date have sold over 85,000 copies combined. The Style of Loish now sees the artist explore her own style through several facets of her work, including creating volume, choosing color, establishing flow, and the ideas and subjects themselves. While looking at the motivation behind her own work, Loish also guides the reader through ideas and tutorials to help them identify, understand, and even evolve their own style. The book bursts with brand new, specially commissioned art that provides a unique opportunity to understand the foundations of Loish’s style. She reveals the journey she took to pinpoint when and how her style was created. Combined with candid advice and a passion for supporting fellow artists, the book is beautiful, inspirational, and practical for artists of all styles and abilities.
