Overview
A gorgeous hardcover collector’s edition of Brynne Weaver’s New York Times bestseller, Butcher &amp; Blackbird, featuring a deluxe new package, exclusive illustrated endpapers, a letter from the author, and more! “I want to ruin her so that she’s mine, my beautiful disaster. My wild creature. My goddess of chaos.”
 When a chance encounter sparks an unlikely bond between rival murderers Sloane and Rowan, they find something elusive―the friendship of two like-minded, pitch-black souls who just happen to enjoy killing other serial killers. From small-town West Virginia to upscale California, and from downtown Boston to rural Texas, the two hunters collide in an annual game of blood and suffering, one that pits them against the most dangerous monsters in the country. But as their friendship develops into something more, the restless ghosts left in their wake are only a few steps behind, ready to claim more than just their newfound love. Can Rowan and Sloane dig themselves out of a game of graves? Or have they finally met their match? This international bestselling, viral TikTok, friends-to-lovers dark romantic comedy is full of murder, chaos, and sizzling chemistry―and unlike anything you’ve read before.
