Overview
The reunited Jedi prepare to strike back against the ruthless Nihil in this thrilling sequel to Star Wars: The Eye of Darkness.
 Â 
 For over a year, Jedi Masters Avar Kriss and Elzar Mann were kept apart by the Nihilâ€™s Stormwall. After Avar makes a daring escape from inside the Occlusion Zone, the star-crossed Jedi are reunited. But while the physical distance between them has evaporated, their shared grief over their failure to protect the galaxy from the Nihil threat remains.
 Â 
 To rally the Jedi Order and the Republic, Avar and Elzar cling to their belief in serving Light and Life. Together, they lead a daring mission into Nihil space to liberate the planet of Naboo and show those trapped behind the Stormwall that the Jedi will never abandon them. Now back within close orbit of each other, the two Jedi Masters can no longer deny the bond that has always drawn them back together and made them stronger.
 Â 
 After finally embracing their true desires and imbued with renewed purpose, Avar and Elzar devise a plan to turn the tide of the conflict with the Nihil once and for all. Accompanied by Jedi Knights Bell Zettifar, Burryaga, and Vernestra Rwoh, the Jedi begin their hunt for Marchion Ro. But to seek out the Nihilâ€™s dangerous leader, the Jedi will have to survive the Nameless terrors that thus far they have been powerless to stop.
