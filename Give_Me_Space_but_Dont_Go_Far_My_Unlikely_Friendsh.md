A tender, funny, illustrated memoir about anxiety and self-acceptance from the artist behind @haleydrewthis
 
 Anxiety has been glued to Haley Weaverâ€™s side since she was a child. Like most people, Weaver saw the constant what-ifs and worst-case scenarios that Anxiety whispered in her ear as an obstacle to her happiness. Maybe she could dump her anxiety at her therapistâ€™s office, or send it on a trip far, far awayâ€”anything to get rid of it for good. But over time she realized anxietyâ€™s true intention: to keep her safe. Could she learn to let it do its job but also figure out how to live without constant worry and fear?
 This full-color, illustrated memoir stars Haley and Anxiety (as themselves) and showcases their complicated but ultimately uplifting relationship. It also introduces readers to the helpful (and not-so-helpful) coping mechanisms Haley relies on to soften the edges of her mental health issues. Thereâ€™s the Distractor, who wears a bright red boa and encourages Haley to avoid uncomfortable feelings by scrolling the Internet, the Liar, who teaches Haley the pillars of a good fib in order to survive at the middle school lunch table, and even the Partier, who gives Haley a social life in college but also lands her in the ER. From detailing her first unsupervised birthday party as a preteen to exploring the overwhelming life transitions as an adult, Give Me Space but Donâ€™t Go Far brings to life the pivotal moments of Haleyâ€™s life and illuminates the lesson sheâ€™s learned: With care, practice, and sound strategies, we can learn to coexist with our anxietyâ€”and maybe even love it.
