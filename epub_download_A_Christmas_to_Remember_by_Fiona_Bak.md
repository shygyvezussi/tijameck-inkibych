Overview
A sweet, uplifting small-town holiday romance that celebrates the bonds between family and the magic of the season. Settle in by the light of the Christmas tree and get swept away to this charming mountain town!

 When the magazine that Margo Stoker works for downsizes and lays her off, it knocks her for a loop. She left her small hometown years ago, eager to explore the world and make a name for herself. But without a job to keep her busy, she decides to visit Evergreen Hollow for the first time in years-just in time for the holidays. She figures she&#039;ll pop into town, catch up briefly with her parents and her two sisters, and then be on her way... but those plans go out the window when a skiing accident leads to a broken leg, stranding her there for much longer than she anticipated. Dr. Spencer Thorpe recently took over his father&#039;s medical practice in Evergreen Hollow, and he loves the tight-knit community and the slower pace of life there. Still, when a beautiful and vivacious out-of-towner shows up at his office with a skiing injury, he&#039;s drawn to her right away. There&#039;s no way that Margo can let herself fall for Spencer-not when she plans to leave town as soon as possible. But as walks in the snow turn to romantic sleigh rides and kisses under the mistletoe, she starts to realize that no matter where she goes... she&#039;ll leave her heart in Evergreen Hollow. But can she truly stay in the rustic little town forever? Especially when she had a good reason for leaving in the first place?
