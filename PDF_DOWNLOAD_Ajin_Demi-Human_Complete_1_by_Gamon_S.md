WHAT KILLS YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER
 
 For Kei, and at least forty-six others, immortality comes as the nastiest surprise ever. He’s a rare specimen who needs to be experimented on for life—a demi-human who must die a thousand deaths for the benefit of humanity…
 
 The breathless nightmare trip Ajin: Demi-Human, finally available in omnibus format. A thriller that just keeps on getting better and deeper.
 
 “Sakurai is great at both bullet-spraying, neck-snapping action and subtle facial expressions that say more than the dialogue that accompanies them. Ajin started out as something worth keeping up with, but now it’s up there with some of my favorite current regulars.” —Otaku USA
 
 “Sakurai’s page layouts are very easy to read, and the smooth translation and fast-paced story make this a very quick read, although it is also one you’re likely to want to reread in order not to miss any details.” —Anime News Network
